      "question": "Which type of firewall operates at the network layer, making decisions based solely on the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, without inspecting the actual content of the packets or tracking the state of connections?",

          "text": "Proxy firewall",
          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "A packet-filtering firewall examines individual packets in isolation, based on predefined rules (e.g., IP addresses, port numbers, protocols). It does not maintain context about the connection's state, unlike stateful inspection firewalls, nor does it operate at higher application layers like proxy or next-generation firewalls.",

        }
      ],
      "explanation": "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric block cipher that superseded DES. It encrypts data in 128-bit blocks and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, making it a robust standard for data encryption. RSA and ECC are asymmetric algorithms, while SHA-256 is a hashing algorithm.",

      "question": "An application allows users to upload profile pictures. An attacker discovers that the application does not properly validate the file type or content, allowing them to upload a malicious script disguised as an image. When another user views the profile, the script executes in their browser, stealing their session cookie. Which OWASP Top 10 (2021) vulnerability does this scenario primarily represent?",

          "correct": true
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "This scenario falls under \"Software and Data Integrity Failures\" (A08:2021). It involves a lack of integrity checks on critical data (uploaded files), allowing untrusted data (malicious script) to be processed or stored, which can lead to system compromise or execution of unauthorized code. While elements of \"Insecure Design\" could contribute, the direct failure to validate and ensure the integrity of uploaded data is the core issue.",

      "question": "To prevent SQL Injection attacks, which secure coding practice should be primarily employed when constructing database queries based on user input?",

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "While input validation (A) is important for overall security, using prepared statements with parameterized queries (C) is the most effective and direct defense against SQL Injection. It ensures that user input is treated as data, not as executable code, preventing attackers from altering the query's logic. Output encoding (B) is for XSS prevention, and least privilege (D) is a general security principle, not a direct SQLi prevention method for query construction.",

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "In the IaaS model, AWS is responsible for the \"security *of* the cloud\" (physical infrastructure, network, hypervisor), while the customer is responsible for \"security *in* the cloud.\" This includes managing the guest operating system (OS patching, configuration), applications, data, and network configurations within their EC2 instances.",
