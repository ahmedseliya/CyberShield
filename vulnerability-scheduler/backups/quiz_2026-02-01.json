      "question": "Which type of firewall operates at the application layer, inspecting the actual content of network packets and often acting as a proxy for specific services?",

        }
      ],
      "explanation": "A proxy or application-layer firewall operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. It inspects the content of traffic for specific applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP) and can act as an intermediary, breaking the client-server connection to perform deep packet inspection and enforce granular policies. While NGFWs incorporate application-layer inspection, the most direct answer for a firewall *type* specifically known for this function is the proxy firewall.",

      "question": "A web application allows users to upload profile pictures. However, it fails to properly validate the file type and content, leading to a scenario where an attacker uploads a malicious script disguised as an image. This vulnerability most closely aligns with which OWASP Top 10 category?",
      "options": [

          "text": "Security Misconfiguration",
          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "While this scenario could lead to other issues like Injection (if the script is executed by the server) or Security Misconfiguration (if the server is poorly configured to execute such files), the primary vulnerability described is the lack of validation on uploaded files, allowing \"Unrestricted Upload of Dangerous Types.\" This was a specific category in older OWASP Top 10 lists (e.g., 2013 A8) and is now often subsumed under broader categories like \"Security Misconfiguration\" or \"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\" if it leads to server-side execution. However, given the options, \"Unrestricted Upload of Dangerous Types\" is the most direct fit for the description of the vulnerability itself. If this exact option wasn't present, \"Security Misconfiguration\" would be a broader, plausible alternative in more recent OWASP versions.",

      "question": "To prevent SQL Injection attacks, which secure coding practice should be the primary method used when constructing database queries based on user input?",

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "While input validation (A) is crucial for data integrity and other vulnerabilities, and escaping characters (D) can help but is prone to errors, using prepared statements with parameterized queries (C) is the most effective and recommended defense against SQL Injection. It ensures that user input is treated as data, not as executable code, by separating the query structure from the user-supplied values. Stored procedures (B) can be secure if they are parameterized, but prepared statements are a more general and fundamental approach.",

      "explanation": "In an IaaS model, the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is responsible for the security *of* the cloud (e.g., physical infrastructure, virtualization layer).

      "explanation": "The \"Containment, Eradication, and Recovery\" phase is where the active measures to mitigate the incident occur. Containment focuses on limiting the damage, Eradication involves removing the threat and its root cause, and Recovery is about restoring affected systems and services to their operational state. Preparation occurs before an incident, Detection and Analysis identifies and assesses the incident, and Post-Incident Activity (or Lessons Learned) happens after the incident is resolved.",
