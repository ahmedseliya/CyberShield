Q1: Which threat intelligence framework provides a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations?
A) ISO 27001
B) NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
C) MITRE ATT&CK
D) OpenIOC
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: MITRE ATT&CK is a widely recognized and comprehensive knowledge base that details adversary tactics and techniques observed in real-world cyberattacks, providing a foundation for developing specific threat models and methodologies.
CATEGORY: Threat intelligence frameworks

Q2: What is the primary purpose of a vulnerability scanner in a cybersecurity program?
A) To deploy security patches automatically across all systems.
B) To monitor network traffic for real-time intrusion attempts.
C) To identify security weaknesses and misconfigurations in systems and applications.
D) To encrypt all data at rest and in transit within an organization.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: Vulnerability scanners are designed to systematically examine systems, networks, and applications to detect known security flaws, misconfigurations, and other weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
CATEGORY: Vulnerability assessment tools

Q3: Which security architecture framework emphasizes a business-driven approach, aligning security services with business objectives and risk tolerance?
A) TOGAF
B) SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)
C) ITIL
D) COBIT
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: SABSA is a business-driven security architecture framework that focuses on creating a security architecture that directly supports and aligns with the strategic objectives and risk appetite of the business. TOGAF is a general enterprise architecture framework, while ITIL and COBIT focus on IT service management and governance, respectively.
CATEGORY: Security architecture frameworks

Q4: In a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) setup, what is the primary benefit of integrating Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms?
A) To provide long-term storage and archival of all security logs for compliance.
B) To automate repetitive security tasks and orchestrate complex incident response workflows.
C) To perform deep packet inspection on all incoming and outgoing network traffic.
D) To generate executive-level reports on overall security posture and budget allocation.
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: SOAR platforms are crucial for modern SOCs because they enable the automation of routine security tasks (e.g., threat enrichment, indicator blocking) and orchestrate the steps of incident response playbooks, significantly reducing response times and analyst workload.
CATEGORY: Security Operations Center (SOC) setup

Q5: Which of the following is a common component used in physical access control systems to verify an individual's identity?
A) Firewall
B) Biometric scanner
C) Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
D) Virtual Private Network (VPN)
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: A biometric scanner (e.g., fingerprint, retina, facial recognition) is a device used in physical access control systems to authenticate individuals based on unique biological characteristics, granting or denying entry to a secured area. Firewalls, IDS, and VPNs are related to network security.
CATEGORY: Physical access control systems
DIFFICULTY: easy

Q6: What is the primary objective of conducting a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) in the context of business continuity planning?
A) To identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to an organization's assets.
B) To determine the Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) for critical business functions.
C) To calculate the total cost of ownership for all IT infrastructure.
D) To develop detailed recovery strategies for specific IT systems.
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: The primary objective of a BIA is to identify critical business functions and processes, and then determine the potential impact of disruptions to these functions, including establishing metrics like Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
