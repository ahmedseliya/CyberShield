      "explanation": "A crucial first step in implementing ISO 27001 is defining the scope of the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

      "explanation": "The Exploitation phase is where the penetration tester actively attempts to compromise systems by leveraging discovered vulnerabilities. This phase involves using tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gain initial access, bypass security controls, and achieve specific objectives like privilege escalation or data exfiltration. Reconnaissance and Scanning are preparatory phases, while Post-Exploitation occurs after initial access is gained to maintain persistence, pivot, and further compromise the environment.",

      "explanation": "The primary benefit of a SOAR platform is to automate repetitive security tasks, orchestrate disparate security tools, and streamline incident response workflows. This allows security analysts to focus on more complex threats, reduces response times, and improves the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the SOC. While SOAR can use threat intelligence and integrate with log sources, its core value is in automation and orchestration.",
