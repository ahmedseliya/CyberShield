Q1: Which of the following is NOT one of the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?
A) Identify
B) Protect
C) Recover
D) Encrypt
ANSWER: D

Q2: What is a primary security challenge associated with many Internet of Things (IoT) devices?
A) Over-reliance on strong, unique default passwords.
B) Frequent and automatic security updates from manufacturers.
C) Limited processing power and memory for robust security features.
D) Standardized communication protocols across all device types.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: Many IoT devices are designed with minimal processing power and memory to keep costs low and power consumption down, which often limits their ability to implement strong encryption, complex authentication, or frequent security updates.
CATEGORY: IoT security challenges
DIFFICULTY: easy

Q3: An attacker sends an email that appears to be from a senior executive, urging immediate transfer of funds to a new vendor account. This is an example of which type of phishing attack?
A) Smishing
B) Vishing
C) Whaling

Q4: Which of the following is a key capability provided by Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions?
A) Creating custom operating systems for mobile devices.
B) Physically securing devices in a locked cabinet.
C) Remotely wiping data from a lost or stolen device.
D) Developing new mobile applications for employees.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: MDM solutions allow organizations to manage, monitor, and secure mobile devices. A critical feature is the ability to remotely wipe sensitive corporate data from a device if it is lost, stolen, or an employee leaves the company, preventing unauthorized access.
CATEGORY: Mobile device management (MDM)
DIFFICULTY: easy

Q5: An organization classifies data into categories such as "Public," "Internal Use Only," "Confidential," and "Restricted." This approach is primarily concerned with what aspect of data?
A) Data format
B) Data origin
C) Data sensitivity
D) Data volume
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: Data classification schemes like "Public," "Internal Use Only," "Confidential," and "Restricted" are designed to categorize data based on its sensitivity and the potential impact if it were to be compromised, lost, or disclosed without authorization. This helps determine appropriate security controls.
CATEGORY: Data classification schemes
DIFFICULTY: hard

Q6: What is the primary benefit of implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) in an enterprise environment?
A) Eliminates the need for any form of user authentication.
B) Requires users to create a unique password for each application.
C) Enhances user convenience and reduces password fatigue.
D) Automatically encrypts all data stored in cloud applications.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: SSO allows users to authenticate once with a single set of credentials and then gain access to multiple independent software systems without re-authenticating. This significantly improves user convenience by reducing the number of passwords users need to remember and manage.
CATEGORY: Single Sign-On (SSO) implementation
