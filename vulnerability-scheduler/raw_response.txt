Q1: Which of the following is a common social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to trick users into revealing sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy entity?
A) DDoS Attack
B) Phishing
C) Brute-force Attack
D) SQL Injection
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: Phishing is a social engineering technique used to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, often by masquerading as a reputable entity in an email or other communication.

Q2: What is the primary function of a firewall in a network security context?
A) To encrypt all outgoing traffic.
B) To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
C) To store encrypted backups of sensitive data.
D) To detect and remove malware from endpoints.
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: A firewall acts as a barrier, monitoring and filtering network traffic to prevent unauthorized access and threats based on a set of defined security rules.

Q3: Which of the following is considered a strong password best practice?
A) Using easily guessable personal information like birthdates.
B) Reusing the same password across multiple accounts.
C) Creating a long, complex password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
D) Writing down your password and keeping it under your keyboard.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: Strong passwords are long, unique, and incorporate a variety of character types to make them difficult to guess or crack.

Q4: In an interview, you're asked about tools for centralized security log management and real-time analysis. Which technology would you describe?
A) Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
B) Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
C) Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
D) Virtual Private Network (VPN)
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: SIEM systems collect, aggregate, and analyze security logs and events from various sources across an organization's IT infrastructure, providing real-time monitoring and alerting for security incidents.

Q5: A common web application vulnerability listed in the OWASP Top 10 involves injecting malicious code into input fields to manipulate database queries or execute commands. What is this vulnerability called?
A) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
B) Broken Authentication
C) Security Misconfiguration
D) Injection (e.g., SQL Injection)
ANSWER: D
EXPLANATION: Injection flaws, such as SQL Injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, allowing attackers to trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands.

Q6: An organization wants to enhance its login security beyond just passwords. They decide to implement a system where users must provide something they know (password) and something they have (a code from a mobile app). What security measure is this?
A) Single Sign-On (SSO)
B) Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
C) Biometric Authentication
D) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, typically combining "something you know," "something you have," or "something you are."

Q7: During an incident response interview, you are asked about the first step after an incident has been detected. Which phase typically follows detection in a standard incident response lifecycle?
A) Eradication
B) Recovery
C) Preparation
D) Containment
ANSWER: D
EXPLANATION: The incident response lifecycle typically follows phases like Preparation, Identification/Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity. Containment is the immediate step after detection to limit the scope and impact of the incident.
CATEGORY: Incident Response

Q8: You're explaining cryptographic principles. What is a key characteristic distinguishing asymmetric encryption from symmetric encryption?
A) Asymmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
B) Symmetric encryption uses a pair of mathematically linked keys (public and private).
C) Asymmetric encryption is generally slower but provides secure key exchange and digital signatures.
D) Symmetric encryption is primarily used for secure communication over untrusted networks without prior key exchange.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: Asymmetric encryption uses separate public and private keys, making key exchange secure but is computationally more intensive (slower) than symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key and is faster but requires a secure method for key exchange.
CATEGORY: Cryptography
DIFFICULTY: hard

Q9: In a security architecture discussion, you advocate for a "Zero Trust" model. What is the fundamental principle of this model?
A) All internal network traffic is inherently trusted, while external traffic is untrusted.
B) Trust is established once a user authenticates, allowing broad access to resources.
C) Never trust, always verify, regardless of whether the user or device is inside or outside the network perimeter.
D) Trust is granted based on the physical location of the device within the corporate office.
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: The Zero Trust model operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes no implicit trust is granted to assets or users based solely on their physical or network location, requiring strict verification for every access request.

Q10: During a threat modeling exercise for a new application, you apply the STRIDE framework. Which of the following threat categories does 'R' in STRIDE represent?
A) Repudiation
B) Reconnaissance
C) Ransomware
D) Resilience
ANSWER: A
EXPLANATION: STRIDE is a threat modeling framework where S=Spoofing, T=Tampering, R=Repudiation, I=Information Disclosure, D=Denial of Service, E=Elevation of Privilege. Repudiation refers to the ability of an attacker to deny having performed an action.
