Q1: Which of the following frameworks provides a standardized language for describing cyber threat intelligence, including adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators, and campaigns?
A) ITIL
B) COBIT
C) MITRE ATT&CK
D) ISO 27001
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a common language for describing threat intelligence. ITIL and COBIT are IT service management and governance frameworks, respectively. ISO 27001 is an information security management system standard.

Q2: Which type of tool is primarily used to identify security weaknesses in network devices, operating systems, and applications by scanning for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations?
A) Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
B) Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
C) Vulnerability Scanner
D) Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: A vulnerability scanner is specifically designed to identify security weaknesses and misconfigurations by comparing system configurations and software versions against a database of known vulnerabilities. DLP prevents data exfiltration, IDS detects intrusions, and SIEM aggregates and analyzes security logs.
CATEGORY: Vulnerability assessment tools

Q3: Which security architecture framework is renowned for its business-driven approach, starting with business requirements and risk to design a holistic and layered security architecture?
A) TOGAF
B) SABSA
C) Zachman Framework
D) ITIL
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) is a risk-driven enterprise security architecture framework that explicitly promotes designing security from the business requirements down, leading to a defense-in-depth approach. TOGAF is a general enterprise architecture framework, Zachman is an enterprise architecture ontology, and ITIL is an IT service management framework.

Q4: In a Security Operations Center (SOC), which function is primarily responsible for the continuous monitoring of security events, alerts, and logs from various sources to detect potential threats in real-time?
A) Patch Management
B) Incident Response
C) Threat Hunting
D) Security Monitoring and Alerting
ANSWER: D
EXPLANATION: Security Monitoring and Alerting is a core function of a SOC, involving the continuous collection and analysis of security logs and events from various sources (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS) to detect suspicious activities and generate alerts for further investigation. Patch management is part of vulnerability management, incident response handles confirmed incidents, and threat hunting proactively searches for undetected threats.

Q5: Which component of a physical access control system is responsible for verifying a user's identity based on a unique physical characteristic, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, to grant or deny entry?
A) RFID Reader
B) Magnetic Lock
C) Biometric Scanner
D) Door Contact Sensor
ANSWER: C
EXPLANATION: A biometric scanner uses unique biological characteristics (like fingerprints, facial features, or iris patterns) for identity verification, providing a strong form of authentication in physical access control. RFID readers use radio waves for card-based access, magnetic locks secure doors, and door contact sensors detect door status.
CATEGORY: Physical access control systems

Q6: A critical output of a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is the identification of Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). What is the primary purpose of defining these metrics within the BIA context?
A) To determine the cost of implementing new security controls.
B) To establish the maximum tolerable downtime and data loss for critical business functions.
C) To identify potential single points of failure in the IT infrastructure.
D) To prioritize the order of system restoration after a cyberattack.
ANSWER: B
EXPLANATION: The primary purpose of defining RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) in a BIA is to quantify the maximum acceptable downtime and data loss, respectively, for critical business processes and systems. This information is crucial for developing effective disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. While a BIA might indirectly inform security control costs or identify single points of failure, and RTO/RPO guide restoration order, their direct purpose in the BIA is to establish these tolerance levels based on business impact.
